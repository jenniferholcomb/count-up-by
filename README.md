## Description
(Ep.Lesson)[https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/introduction-to-programming/arrays-and-looping/practice-looping-with-for]

### Objectives 

Create a program that takes two numbers â€” one to count to and another to determine what multiple to use to get there.

### Goals
Here is some sample input:
Count to: 30
Count by: 5
Output: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30

Count to: 50
Count by: 7
Output: 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, 49

Don't forget to consider how to handle any input that might be submitted:

Empty values (user just presses enter)
Non-numeric values (It may be helpful to read up about the numerical value, NaN)
Negative numbers
Count by number is larger than the count to numbers
